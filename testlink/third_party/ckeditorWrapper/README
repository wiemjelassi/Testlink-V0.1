README - CKEditorWrapperPHP.php

This file was created using the php files that were provided
to semplify the use of CKEditor with PHP.
The files were provided with CKEditor version 3, but it were removed since version 4.

This way to work with CKEditor was confortable, then I see no reason
to change.

Original Files

ckeditor.php
  just allowed to switch between PHP4 and PHP5 versions

ckeditor_php5.php
  class implementation, I've renamed to CKEditorWrapperPHP.php

ckeditor.class.php
  was created for TestLink, and moved since version 1.9.20 
  to the [TL INSTALL DIR]/lib/functions/  folder.
